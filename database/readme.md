Welcome to Spencer Romo's Docker based PostgreSQL instance, to be deployed on docker. 
This is to be the location of code that runs a postgres instance on a docker container.  
It will serve as the main database for the data computation projects to be undertaken. 


Currently the docker instance is hosted on an amazon linux instance of an EC2.  This ec2 can only be accessed from Spencer's personal computer, and anybody requiring access should ask him to allow them such.
