This is the django project where magic should and hopefully will take place.  

Please look through the run.sh script to add environment variables as appropriate. 

The models currently in here are simply for testing.

The Project covers 3 exchanges. The NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX

The objectives for the MVP is as follows:
	1) Create an efficient database and code structure for extraction of information, and computation.
	2) Leverage news information, and other relevant sources.
	3) Create a system of predictive analytics.  Predict if a stock will go up or down in a given day.
	4) Create a system of back-testing, and programatic jobs that seek to improve the accuracy of the predictions made by the system.   
	5) Create a front end system to visualize the information created by the above tasks. 
	6) Create a front end system that allows users to run tests of their own creation.
